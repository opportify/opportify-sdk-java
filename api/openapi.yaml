    \ powerful and up-to-date platform. With advanced data warehousing and AI-driven\
    \ capabilities, this API is designed to empower your business to make informed,\
    \ data-driven decisions and effectively assess potential risks.\n\n### Base URL\n\
    Use the following base URL for all API requests:\n\n```plaintext\nhttps://api.opportify.ai/insights/v1/<service>/<endpoint>\n\
    ```\n\n### Features\n- [**Email Insights:**](/docs/api/api-reference/email-insights)\n\
    \  - Validate email syntax.\n  - Identify email types (free, disposable, private\
    \ or unknown).\n  - Real time verifications:\n    - Reachable: Confirms if the\
    \ email domain has valid MX DNS records using DNS lookup.\n    - Deliverable:\
    \ Simulates an SMTP handshake to check if the email address exists and is deliverable.\n\
    \    - Catch-All: Detects if the domain accepts all emails (catch-all configuration).\n\
    \  - Intelligent Error Correction: Automatically corrects well-known misspelled\
    \ email addresses.\n  - Risk Report: Provides an AI-driven normalized score (200-1000)\
    \ to evaluate email risk, using predefined thresholds.\n  \n  [Access Documentation\
    \ >>](/docs/api/api-reference/email-insights)\n\n- [**IP Insights:**](/docs/api/api-reference/ip-insights)\n\
    \  - Connection types: Detects connection types such as `wired`, `mobile`, `enterprise`,\
    \ `satellite`, `VPN`, `cloud-provider`, `open-proxy`, or `Tor`.\n  - Geo location:\
    \ Delivers detailed insights such as country, city, timezone, language preferences,\
    \ and additional location-based information to enhance regional understanding.\n\
    \  - WHOIS: Provides main details including RIR, ASN, organization, and abuse/admin/technical\
    \ contacts.\n  - Trusted Provider Recognition: Identifies if the IP is part of\
    \ a known trusted provider (e.g., ZTNA - Zero Trust Network Access).\n  - Blocklist\
    \ Reports: Retrieves up-to-date blocklist statuses, active reports, and the latest\
    \ detections.\n  - Risk Report: Delivers an AI-driven normalized score (200-1000)\

    - **API Key:** Access to the API requires an API key, which must be included in\
    \ the request headers. Businesses can generate unlimited API keys directly from\
    \ their account, offering flexibility and ease of use. \n- **ACL Rules:** Enhance\
    \ security with Access Control Lists (ACL), allowing you to restrict API access\
    \ from specific IP addresses or ranges. This feature provides an additional layer\
    \ of protection by ensuring only authorized IPs can interact with the API.\n-\
    \ **No Query Parameters:** As a precautionary measure, our API avoids the use\
    \ of query parameters for all operations, including authentication and handling\
    \ Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This approach minimizes security\
    \ risks by preventing sensitive data from being exposed in access logs, browser\
    \ history, cached URLs, debugging tools, or inadvertently shared URLs. All sensitive\

      description: "### Risk Level Determination\nThis documentation outlines how\
        \ the risk report is determined based on a `normalizedScore` generated by\
        \ analyzing multiple email-related parameters against predefined risk factors\
        \ (`baseAnalysis`). The risk report encapsulates the likelihood of various\
        \ risk scenarios, enabling effective classification and prioritization of\
        \ risks.   \n\nThe underlying analysis evaluates the provided email information\
        \ against key risk factors, such as the likelihood of bounces, fraud detection\
        \ signals, and email deliverability issues. These insights are used to generate\
        \ a comprehensive risk report, which is then mapped to static risk levels\
        \ for easier interpretation.   \n\n#### How the Score is Generated\n\nThe\
        \ risk score (`normalizedScore`) is derived from a multivariate analysis of\
        \ input parameters, comparing them against risk factors included in `baseAnalysis`.\
        \ This process involves:\n\n##### Key Features of the Model:\n1. **Dynamic\
        \ Scoring:** The model assigns weights to various risk factors, dynamically\
        \ updating them based on training with new data.\n2. **Constant Training:**\
        \ The model is continuously retrained with the latest data to improve accuracy\
        \ and adapt to evolving risk patterns.\n3. **Scalability:** The model supports\
        \ multiple features and their interactions, deriving a comprehensive and reliable\
        \ risk score.\n\nThe output score is normalized to a range of **200–1000**\
        \ for easier interpretation and alignment with industry practices.\n\n---\n\
        \n#### Risk Level Thresholds\n\nThe risk level is a static representation\
        \ of the `normalizedScore`, categorized into five distinct levels:\n\n| **Risk\
        \ Level** | **Score Range**          | **Description**                   \
        \                                              |\n|----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\
        | `highest`      | `normalizedScore > 800` | Represents the most critical\
        \ level of risk. Immediate attention is required.   |\n| `high`         |\
        \ `600 < normalizedScore <= 800` | Indicates a high level of risk. Consider\
        \ mitigation actions promptly.          |\n| `medium`       | `400 < normalizedScore\
        \ <= 600` | Reflects a moderate level of risk. Monitoring and possible action\
        \ advised.     |\n| `low`          | `300 < normalizedScore <= 400` | Denotes\
        \ a low level of risk. Regular monitoring is sufficient.                 |\n\
        | `lowest`       | `normalizedScore <= 300` | The lowest level of risk. Risk\
        \ is considered negligible or minimal.            |\n\n---\n\n#### Usage\n\
        \nThis risk level determination serves as a human-readable representation\
        \ of the machine learning model's output. It enables:\n- **Risk Monitoring:**\
        \ Identifying entities that require immediate attention.\n- **Action Prioritization:**\
        \ Guiding mitigation efforts based on the severity of the risk.\n- **Decision-Making:**\
        \ Providing clear thresholds for automated and manual workflows.\n\n---\n\n\
        #### Key Notes\n1. **Dynamic Scoring, Static Levels:**\n  - While the score\
        \ is dynamically updated through a multivariate linear regression model, the\
        \ risk levels remain static to maintain consistency and interpretability.\n\
        \n2. **Customizable Thresholds:**\n  - The thresholds for the levels are configurable\
        \ based on organizational needs or domain-specific requirements.\n\n3. **Model\
        \ Retraining:** \n  - Regular updates to the model ensure that scores accurately\
        \ reflect real-world risk trends, improving the reliability of level assignments.\n\
        \n4. **Risk Bucket Floors:**\n  - Certain high-risk conditions enforce minimum\
        \ scores and levels. Disposable domains, undeliverable states, missing MX\
        \ records, and no-reply detections (flagged as `noreply-detected`) cannot\
        \ be downgraded below `high`.\n\n---\n\nThis approach combines the adaptability\
        \ of multivariate linear regression with the simplicity of static thresholds,\
        \ offering a robust framework for risk assessment and decision-making.\n\n\

      description: "### Risk Level Determination\nThis documentation outlines how\
        \ the risk level is determined based on a `normalizedScore` generated by a\
        \ **multivariate linear regression model**. The risk level provides a static\
        \ representation of thresholds to classify the severity of risk for an entity.\n\
        \n#### How the Score is Generated\n\nThe risk score (`normalizedScore`) is\
        \ computed using a **multivariate linear regression model**, a machine learning\
        \ approach that evaluates multiple input features to predict the risk score.\n\
        \n##### Key Features of the Model:\n1. **Dynamic Scoring:** The model assigns\
        \ weights to various risk factors, dynamically updating them based on training\
        \ with new data.\n2. **Constant Training:** The model is continuously retrained\
        \ with the latest data to improve accuracy and adapt to evolving risk patterns.\n\
        3. **Scalability:** The model supports multiple features and their interactions,\
        \ deriving a comprehensive and reliable risk score.\n\nThe output score is\
        \ normalized to a range of **200–1000** for easier interpretation and alignment\
        \ with industry practices.\n\n---\n\n#### Risk Level Thresholds\n\nThe risk\
        \ level is a static representation of the `normalizedScore`, categorized into\
        \ five distinct levels:\n\n| **Risk Level** | **Score Range**          | **Description**\
