### Risk Level Determination This documentation outlines how the risk level is determined based on a `normalizedScore` generated by a **multivariate linear regression model**. The risk level provides a static representation of thresholds to classify the severity of risk for an entity.  #### How the Score is Generated  The risk score (`normalizedScore`) is computed using a **multivariate linear regression model**, a machine learning approach that evaluates multiple input features to predict the risk score.  ##### Key Features of the Model: 1. **Dynamic Scoring:** The model assigns weights to various risk factors, dynamically updating them based on training with new data. 2. **Constant Training:** The model is continuously retrained with the latest data to improve accuracy and adapt to evolving risk patterns. 3. **Scalability:** The model supports multiple features and their interactions, deriving a comprehensive and reliable risk score.  The output score is normalized to a range of **200–1000** for easier interpretation and alignment with industry practices.  ---  #### Risk Level Thresholds  The risk level is a static representation of the `normalizedScore`, categorized into five distinct levels:  | **Risk Level** | **Score Range**          | **Description**                                                                 | |----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | `highest`      | `normalizedScore > 800` | Represents the most critical level of risk. Immediate attention is required.   | | `high`         | `600 < normalizedScore <= 800` | Indicates a high level of risk. Consider mitigation actions promptly.          | | `medium`       | `400 < normalizedScore <= 600` | Reflects a moderate level of risk. Monitoring and possible action advised.     | | `low`          | `300 < normalizedScore <= 400` | Denotes a low level of risk. Regular monitoring is sufficient.                 | | `lowest`       | `normalizedScore <= 300` | The lowest level of risk. Risk is considered negligible or minimal.            |  ---  #### Usage  This risk level determination serves as a human-readable representation of the machine learning model's output. It enables: - **Risk Monitoring:** Identifying entities that require immediate attention. - **Action Prioritization:** Guiding mitigation efforts based on the severity of the risk. - **Decision-Making:** Providing clear thresholds for automated and manual workflows.  ---  #### Key Notes 1. **Dynamic Scoring, Static Levels:**   - While the score is dynamically updated through a multivariate linear regression model, the risk levels remain static to maintain consistency and interpretability.  2. **Customizable Thresholds:**   - The thresholds for the levels are configurable based on organizational needs or domain-specific requirements.  3. **Model Retraining:**    - Regular updates to the model ensure that scores accurately reflect real-world risk trends, improving the reliability of level assignments.  ---  This approach combines the adaptability of multivariate linear regression with the simplicity of static thresholds, offering a robust framework for risk assessment and decision-making.  ---  ### Response Elements
