### Risk Level Determination This documentation outlines how the risk report is determined based on a `normalizedScore` generated by analyzing multiple email-related parameters against predefined risk factors (`baseAnalysis`). The risk report encapsulates the likelihood of various risk scenarios, enabling effective classification and prioritization of risks.     The underlying analysis evaluates the provided email information against key risk factors, such as the likelihood of bounces, fraud detection signals, and email deliverability issues. These insights are used to generate a comprehensive risk report, which is then mapped to static risk levels for easier interpretation.     #### How the Score is Generated  The risk score (`normalizedScore`) is derived from a multivariate analysis of input parameters, comparing them against risk factors included in `baseAnalysis`. This process involves:  ##### Key Features of the Model: 1. **Dynamic Scoring:** The model assigns weights to various risk factors, dynamically updating them based on training with new data. 2. **Constant Training:** The model is continuously retrained with the latest data to improve accuracy and adapt to evolving risk patterns. 3. **Scalability:** The model supports multiple features and their interactions, deriving a comprehensive and reliable risk score.  The output score is normalized to a range of **200–1000** for easier interpretation and alignment with industry practices.  ---  #### Risk Level Thresholds  The risk level is a static representation of the `normalizedScore`, categorized into five distinct levels:  | **Risk Level** | **Score Range**          | **Description**                                                                 | |----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | `highest`      | `normalizedScore > 800` | Represents the most critical level of risk. Immediate attention is required.   | | `high`         | `600 < normalizedScore <= 800` | Indicates a high level of risk. Consider mitigation actions promptly.          | | `medium`       | `400 < normalizedScore <= 600` | Reflects a moderate level of risk. Monitoring and possible action advised.     | | `low`          | `300 < normalizedScore <= 400` | Denotes a low level of risk. Regular monitoring is sufficient.                 | | `lowest`       | `normalizedScore <= 300` | The lowest level of risk. Risk is considered negligible or minimal.            |  ---  #### Usage  This risk level determination serves as a human-readable representation of the machine learning model's output. It enables: - **Risk Monitoring:** Identifying entities that require immediate attention. - **Action Prioritization:** Guiding mitigation efforts based on the severity of the risk. - **Decision-Making:** Providing clear thresholds for automated and manual workflows.  ---  #### Key Notes 1. **Dynamic Scoring, Static Levels:**   - While the score is dynamically updated through a multivariate linear regression model, the risk levels remain static to maintain consistency and interpretability.  2. **Customizable Thresholds:**   - The thresholds for the levels are configurable based on organizational needs or domain-specific requirements.  3. **Model Retraining:**    - Regular updates to the model ensure that scores accurately reflect real-world risk trends, improving the reliability of level assignments.  4. **Risk Bucket Floors:**   - Certain high-risk conditions enforce minimum scores and levels. Disposable domains, undeliverable states, missing MX records, and no-reply detections (flagged as `noreply-detected`) cannot be downgraded below `high`.  ---  This approach combines the adaptability of multivariate linear regression with the simplicity of static thresholds, offering a robust framework for risk assessment and decision-making.  ---  ### Response Elements
